# The Autonomous Governance Manifesto

We are learning, creating better ways, and teaching each other how to make governance work well for software & systems. Through this work we have two (2) preordained beliefs.

1. Governance capabilities always provide independence and freedom to operate.
1. Governance must only be autonomic; happening without conscious effort.

In the quest to achieve autonomous governance, we must use drive coherent actions from the principles of:
 
1. Design governability as a feature into our products and processes.
1. Treat governance as a series of intentions where each intention is expressed as a quantifiable outcome that is dynamically and semantically stable.

As a community, we commit to conscious, focused, and persistent design, implementation, and evangelism of autonomous governance beliefs and principals.
